    Calculates the 4-year loss carry-forward for Spanish IRPF.

    This calculator processes annual financial results to track and apply
    net losses against future gains according to Spanish tax law. It handles
    both 'Ganancias y PÃ©rdidas Patrimoniales' (G&P) and 'Rendimientos del
    Capital Mobiliario' (RCM) with their specific compensation rules.

    Key features:
    - Tracks losses for up to 4 years.
    - Applies losses on a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) basis.
    - Handles the 25% compensation limit between G&P and RCM pools.
    - Produces a single, detailed tax analysis table suitable for BI tools.
